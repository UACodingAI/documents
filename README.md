## Case study
We present an exploratory case study of the potential of generative AI coding assistants for accessible and usable web development. 
The research addressed three questions:
(1) Do AI coding assistants generate standards-compliant HTML? 
(2) Does the AI-generated code comply with WCAG 2.2 accessibility guidelines? and 
(3) How usable are the web pages built with generative AI coding assistants? 

A landing page with text, images, links, video, form and JavaScript elements was built with general-purpose conversational AI chatbots (GPAI) and AI-powered, browser-based development platforms (WBAI)
The image  shows the initial prototipe.

We share all landing pages results:
